Agentic AI System Using Model Context Protocol (MCP):


Designed and implemented a client based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to coordinate multiple AI tools — including a custom math computation server and a Microsoft Playwright-driven web automation agent. Integrated the Qwen-QWQ-32B LLM to enable autonomous reasoning, real-time math execution, dynamic web navigation, and current information retrieval. Built using uv for fast async execution and Cursor IDE for rapid LLM-integrated development.# Agents_with_MCP
